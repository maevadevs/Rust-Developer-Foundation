# Check if already installed
clang --version
# If not, search available versions
apt-cache search clang
# Install latest available: In this case, v15
sudo apt-get install clang-15 --install-suggests
```

- For MacOS: Install XCode's compiler

```sh
xcode-select --install
```

- Check if rustup is installed

```sh
# Check if rustup is installed
rustup --version

## Hello World

- Create a `hello-world` project folder
- Add a `src` folder
- Create a `main.rs` file in `src`
- Add the following codes to `main.rs`

```rs
/**
 * Print "Hello, world!" to the console.
 */

fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}

// ON LINUX:
//  Compile $> rustc src/main.rs -o target/main
//  Execute $> ./target/main
// ON WINDOWS:
//  Compile $> rustc src\main.rs -o target\main.exe
//  Execute $> .\target\main.exe

```

- **`main()` is the entrance in every executable Rust program**
  - No parameters
  - No return values
- Rust requires curly brackets around all function bodies
  - Good style to place the opening curly bracket on the same line as the function declaration
  - Automatic formatter tool: `rustfmt` use with `cargo`
  - **Rust style is to indent with 4 spaces, not a tab**
- **`identifier!()` is a macro**
  - Functions and Macros are different in Rust
  - Macros donâ€™t always follow the same rules as Functions
  - `println!()` is a macro / `println()` is a function
  - Most lines of Rust code end with a semicolon

### Compiling Rust Code

- Rust is *Ahead-Of-Time (AOT)*-compiled language
- Compiler: `rustc`
- On Windows, also outputs debugging info as `.pdb` file
- **`rustc` is not enough for larger programs**
  - **We use `cargo` instead**

## Hello Cargo

- Build System and Package Manager
- Allows to manage projects
  - Build codes
  - Download dependencies
  - Building libraries
- It is better to start a project using `cargo`
  - The vast majority of Rust projects are built with `cargo`
- Cargo comes with Rust when installing via `rustup`
- Full documentation for `cargo` is available in the [Cargo Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/)

### Main Commands

The commands are the same no matter which operating system

- `cargo new`
- `cargo build`
- `cargo run`
- `cargo check`

### Check `cargo` Version

```sh
cargo --version
```

### Creating A Project

```sh
cargo new hello-cargo
cd hello-cargo
```

- Creates a new directory and project: `hello-cargo`

```tree
hello-cargo/
|- .gitignore
|- Cargo.toml
|- src/
   |- main.rs
```

Folder or File|Description
:-|:-
`Cargo.toml`|Manage project configs and deps/crates
`src/main.rs`|The entrance of the program
`.git`|Default VCS: Can override with `--vcs` flag
`.gitignore`|Default VCS is `git`: Can override with `--vcs` flag

- **NOTE: Git files are not generated if already within an existing Git repository**
- `Cargo.toml` has multiple sections but the following are defaulted
  - `package`
    - Configure the project as package and compiler info
    - `edition` is the edition of Rust to use
  - `dependencies`
    - List of crates dependencies for the project
    - If none is listed, then the project will install no additional crates
- **All source codes should live in `src`**
- Except for non-source code files, which can be in top-level project directory:
  - README files
  - License information
  - Configuration files
  - Anything else not related to code
- Cargo helps organize projects
  - There is a place for everything
  - Everything is in its place
- ***It is possible to convert a manually-managed project to Cargo project***
  - Move the project code into the `src` directory
  - Create an appropriate `Cargo.toml` file

### Building A Project

- Simply `cd` into the project and run `cargo build`

```sh
cd hello-cargo
cargo build
```

- It builds from `src` folder
  - Creates an executable file in `target/debug`
  - Default build is *Debug Build* (`dev [unoptimized + debuginfo]`)
- First-time run also creates `Cargo.lock`
  - Keeps track of the exact versions of deps/crates in the project
  - *Managed by Cargo: Never need to change this file manually*
  - This file is automatically generated by Cargo
  - It is not intended for manual editing

#### Build And Run At Once

- We can run `cargo run` to build and run at once
- Convenience for *`cargo build` && run binaries*

```sh
cd hello-cargo
cargo run
```

- **NOTE: Cargo will only rebuild if there are changes detected**

#### Check Pre-Build

- `cargo check` allows to check if a project can build without generating the binaries
- Much faster than `cargo build`
  - Skips the step of producing an executable
  - Still generates `target` but not the executable file
  - Helpful for multiple periodical compiling-checks when writing code (e.g. watching for changes, debugging errors)

```sh
cd hello-cargo
cargo check
```

#### Building For Release

- Default build is *Debug Build* (`dev [unoptimized + debuginfo]`)
- To build for release, we use the `--release` option

```sh
cd hello-cargo
cargo build --release
```

- Compiles with optimizations
- Creates an executable file in `target/release`
- Makes Rust code run faster
- But longer build-time is needed
- Only use this for building the final program

### Cargo As Convention

- Cargo is invaluable for large and complex projects
- Additional tooling for project management
- We can use `cargo build` on any project made with `cargo`
